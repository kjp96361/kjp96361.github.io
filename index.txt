	The field of corporate law can be overwhelming and seemingly competitive due to the community increasing in size annually.
In essence, the duties of corporate lawyers are to make sure that all corporate transactions are legal while also being able to advise
corporations on their legal rights and responsibilities. Corporate law requires knowledge of an array of aspects of business such as:
contract law, tax law, and accounting, so it is not uncommon for some to double major in both law and business.
	
	Although many think that corporate law or just law in general requires people to become part of a large law firm, this is not always 
the case. In fact, some corporate attorneys are able and have the flexibility to work from home (albeit many times these cases are for 
smaller corporations). In addition, corporate attorneys can work with others and form a team.

	Lastly, corporate law is a branch of law where many times attorneys do not actually have to go to trial. It is a facet of law that heavily
depends upon the relationship between the lawyer and the corporation that they report to in order to achieve success. Whether it be advising 
the corporation on terms and conditions of contracts or filing government reports for an organization, this field of law requires those who 
have knowledge of business, can complete various duties, and are most importantly dedicated to their responsibilities as an attorney.
